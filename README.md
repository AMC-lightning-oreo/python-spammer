# python-spammer
Making a simple spammer with python to spam your friends becuz you can and they can't :)


# THIS PROJECTS WILL REQUIRE A FEW THINGS:
1) python 3, I recommend the latest version!
2) pynput package for functions to be pulled => https://pypi.org/project/pynput/
3) an IDE that can handle python
4) A functioning computer with a keyboard/trackpad or mouse. It doesn't matter if it is in built or not
5) A form of testing platform to try to make sure it works, basic testing and modification and just to get used to it


# NOTES:
Once the spammer starts, it will not stop until you kill the code or it hits the range limit! Meaning one I run the code, head over to whatsapp, it will spam, however, if you head over to discord without killing the code, it will too, spam on discord! Becuz this replicates the functionality of a keyboard, it will spam on a field you can type on as long as you are on it! Hence I recommend testing the tool before using it!

I don't really care what you use it for, but have fun! If anything illegal or something a user did and it somehow becomes my fault, i will ignore it. Becuz by using this code, you acknowledge that you are taking code from an open source platform, the nature of which, can be dangerous! Also, don't be an asshole and try to drag me into whatever trouble you get! This is after all a place to learn. This is the tool, the user(you) are the wielder, it will only become a weapon it you intend it to be one!


Anyhow, if you like my projects do comment what you would like to see next and pls do consider upvoting and adding my discord bot! Details of which can be found from my site!
